Frog is a config lang that compiles to other config langs with the `miku` compiler.
The compiler currently only compiles to `python` as of now.

We need some help with the project, if you want to help then make a fork and send a Pull Request.

We would also love some help with writing a wiki of some sort.

Thanks, and hopefully to future addition.
